			<p class="indent">Meow, my name is Katrina, and I am a rescue.  I am now 26, human, years old. I would tell you how old I am in cat years, but I only have 18 toes. I mostly spend my days overseeing the house, you see I am the Queen here. Daddy calls me a diva, but ends up doing whatever I ask. When I am not needed to solve a problem, or rule over my subjects, I am usually asleep in my throne or eating. In my younger years my favorite thing to do was too go down to the beach near daddy’s apartment and go looking for fish. People would always stop and stair at me, I’m not sure why, cats do love fish, and a beach is just a super-sized litter box. Anyway, welcome to my website. I hope you have a great time.</p>

			<p class="indent">Hello, my name is Illyria. I am 9 years old in human years. My story is, I was living with my fur family, in a gopher hole, behind the hotel my Daddy was running at the time. One day a very nice lady, caught me and took me inside to this silly looking guy placing me on his shoulder. That silly guy, was Daddy. He immediately left work, went to the pet store, and bought me everything I would need because I was only 3 weeks old. After settling me in, and introducing me to Katrina, daddy got my fur mom and dad fixed, and found homes for my siblings. From that day forward, I grew into the Tortie of Terror, that daddy adores. I don’t really get it, but everyone says I am the Queen of Tortitude whatever that means. All I care is I have daddy’s lap to sleep in, and enough tuna and catnip to last me furever. </p>

			<p class="indent">Hi, my name is Kenzi. I was found by Daddy living on the street, and very hungry. Daddy lives in a super small apartment and really has no space for me, but that did not stop him from bringing me home. I have to say that the best way to find a furever home is to curl up in some humans lap and purr as loud as you can, or Daddy is a sucker for a furface. I really love living here, mostly because daddy made me an attic in the living room, so I have my own bedroom! Also, it does not hurt that I no longer must spend all day looking for food. Daddy says I have eaten and grown so much that he’s not sure he can call me a cat anymore. So, since I am an all-black kitty he calls me his Panther. According to that evil person daddy takes me to, the one who sticks the thermometer up your… Anyway, last time I saw them they said I was a super healthy Panther now. My favorite thing about living here, other then my own room, is I get ALL the catnip I want. So, make sure you check out my videos on our YouTube Channel.</p>

			<p class="indent">Hello, my name is Prince Charming, Charms for short. I am 2 years old, and was also rescued from the street. Daddy found me at the front door of his job all wet from the rain when I was 9 weeks old. I think considering my name it did not take Daddy long to decide to keep me, after all I am Prince Charming. I spend most of my day and night, running around the house and getting into everything I can. My favorite thing to do is “Kitty Bomb” daddy, Katrina, and Kenzi. I don’t think Illyria likes me very much because she used to be the baby of the family and now I am. Anyway, Love you all.</p>
